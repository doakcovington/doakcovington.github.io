There are only so many hours in a day. From November 2019 to March 2020 I would spend 8 hours at work, 8 hours sleeping, and a few hours with my family. This left roughly 2-3 hours a night to devote to working on the Full Stack Web Development. Being a self-paced student was perfect for the amount of time I had to work towards graduating. 

This all changed when the world changed in March. I was now no longer working and had much more time during the day. I saw this as a gift and treated the curriculum as my full time job. I was now flying through the modules and quickly approaching my new portfolio project.

I was excited to build my first web app. I knew what I wanted to create after a few lessons in the Sinatra Module. My wife and I have an ever growing collection of skis in our shed. Unfortunately ski season ended a bit pre-maturely this year, which left time to daydream what next season might bring.

My wife and I both agree that we will be adding to our ski collection this summer. That will leave us with 6 pairs of skis in our shed. It can be difficult to keep track of your ski specifics like width, length, and type. I knew that an online ski database would be a great first web app for me to build. 

My passion for skiing and an understanding of this domain helped me get through the project quickly. Setting up the MVC was a breeze because I was very familiar with skiers and skis. The hardest part of this project was ‘project creep.’ I wasn’t satisfied with the apps MVP and wanted to keep adding more and more. While adding to the project helped me understand the concepts of Sinatra and ActiveRecord, I found that I was probably spending too much time working on it. I needed to move on. 

I am very grateful to have this time to work through the curriculum. I find that it's easier to retain the information and build upon what I’m learning. I also have time to supplement the FlatIron curriculum with outside sources. 

Sinatra is a great framework to quickly build apps on but I’m excited to move onto Rails.
